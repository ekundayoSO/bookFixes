## Try to execute the the commands below:

## run under web-1 in docker
1. php bin/console make:migration
2. php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

## run in terminal in web directory
3. composer require symfony/security-csrf

## Using SQL in phpmyadmin
4. You need to add book.sql to the database

NB: 

## I left the .env when pushing to the github, but once you pull the repo to local and done with all the additional things you want to add, remember to include in ".gitignore file" before pushing to the github again.
